To understand the structure I used, I first need to explain the logic that goes into classifying premier league teams. The top four teams qualify to compete for the most competitive club title, the champions league title. They are placed in the champions league with other top four teams from other leagues across Europe. Fifth place is eligible to compete for the Europa league title, and is placed in the Europa League. Sixth place is elegible to compete for a spot in the Europa league (play-ins). The last three teams in the league are relegated to a lower division. Finally, all the teams in between are guaranteed a spot in the premier league to compete for next year. With that in mind, I wanted my tree classes to reflect the ranking of each of the teams in the league, and have an instance of the parent class for each team. The tree structure begins to come together with this logic in mind.
